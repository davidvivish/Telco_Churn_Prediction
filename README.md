# **Final Project: Telco Customer Churn Prediction**
This project was conducted by a group of students from COMS W4995: Applied Machine Learning at Columbia University.

## **Project Description**
This project addresses the pressing challenge of customer retention in the telecommunications industry. With increasing competition from low-cost and digital players, telcos face growing pressure to retain customers while operating within constrained marketing budgets. Through this project, we use predictive modeling to identify high-value customers at risk of churning, enabling proactive and cost-effective strategies to improve customer loyalty.

## **Problem Statement**
Customer churn significantly threatens revenue and profitability in a highly competitive industry with low product differentiation. This project focuses on developing a data-driven churn detection solution using historical customer data. By identifying early indicators of churn, telcos can take targeted action to mitigate customer loss and improve overall retention rates.

## **Key Insights**
1. **Data Analysis**:
   - Customer churn is significantly imbalanced, with far more customers not churning than those who do.
   - Certain features, such as customer tenure, payment method, and contract type, exhibit strong relationships with churn behavior.

2. **Modeling Outcomes**:
   - Machine learning models, such as Random Forest and XGBoost, effectively predict churn with high accuracy.
   - Feature engineering significantly improved performance metrics, including encoding categorical variables and handling class imbalance.
